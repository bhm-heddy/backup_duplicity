#  list-current-files [--time <time>] <url>
#              Lists the files contained in the most current backup or backup at time.  The
#              information will be extracted from the signature files, not the archive data
#              itself. Thus the whole archive does not have to be downloaded, but on the other
#              hand if the archive has been deleted or corrupted, this command will not detect it.
